# My dotfiles

Where I store all my config files, dotfiles, init files etc.


## Setup

```bash
$ cd ~ 
$ git clone <repo url>
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./install.sh
```

## Note
* **Make sure to run ./install.sh after each update to any config file!**

* Dotfiles branches are possible by simply creating git branches. Again, **run ./install.sh after each update!**

* You may find the history of this repo a little weird. \
That's because nvim config directory was detached (at commit `f4a5737159213a18353b5f15e6d8b377b0544f0f`) 
from this repo into its own repo.
